## Between Episodes

[Detective Dujuan Mohammmed]({{ site.base_url }}{% "_world/detective-jmohammed.md" %}) contacted Alice about her truck.  The dead man is [Orlando Swanson]({{ site.base_url }}{% link "_world/orlando-swanson.md" %}), a relatively small time pimp.  Processing the car for evidence takes a day, and is then returned to her with one heck of a hole in the hood.

## In The Club

Syd will be in The City Club when Jimmie is there, and she'll want to take him home.  If he takes her home:

* He'll be bruised in the morning.
* She'll clean out his refrigerator.
* She apparently used his phone to take pictures of sex acts.

Geordie will identify her as being coverd in the same demonic effluvia as he was on the hood of the truck where the guy got stabbed.
