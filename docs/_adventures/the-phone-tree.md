## The Contract

Sean Brookings, meeting in the City Club.

"Jimmy, hey, I was hoping you could do a job for me.  There's this guy,
Levander Despero, I knew him ten years ago.  He's kind of a reclusive
guy, keeps off the books.  I was wondering if you could track him down
for me.

"Ten years ago, he wanted to do business, but I wasn't ready.  An
opportunity has come up though, and it takes Despero's particular
talents to make the deal work."

Syd will be in The City Club when Jimmie is there, and she'll want to take him
home.  If he takes her home:

## The Rowdy 3

[The Rowdy 3]({{ site.base_url}}{% link "_world/rowdy-three.md" %}) arrive at
the bar where Alice tends, before opening.  They proceed to bust the place up,
but don't injure anybody.  They open a vortex over the pool table.  A blue
light shines through the vortex, and tendrils of energy rise out, and are
quickly sucked down by the Rowdy 3.  The vortex closes and they leave.

## The Club

If Jimmie takes Syd home:

* He'll be bruised in the morning.
* She'll clean out his refrigerator.
* She apparently used his phone to take pictures of sex acts.

Geordie will identify her as being coverd in the same demonic effluvia as he
was on the hood of the truck where the guy got stabbed.


## The Very Handsome Detective

[Detective Dujuan Mohammmed]({{ site.base_url }}{%
"_world/detective-dujuan-mohammed.md" %}) contacted Alice about her
truck.  The dead man is [Orlando Swanson]({{ site.base_url }}{% link
"_world/orlando-swanson.md" %}), a relatively small time pimp.
Processing the car for evidence takes a day, and is then returned to her
with one heck of a hole in the hood.

## Syd Strikes Again

Newton Chambers, someone who lives near Jimmie, is found crucified on the hood of Jimmie's car.  He was not especially well known to Jimmie, but general impression was that he was a bit skeezy.  He seems like the kind of guy whose dates might all be rentals.
